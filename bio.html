Institute, in the College of Engineering, at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and a Sponsored
Scientist at the Robotics Institute in the School of Computer Science at CMU. He is also a Senior
Research Scientist at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI), in Pittsburgh, where he
leads the Robot Learning Labâ€”focused on developing dexterous robots that extend the
capabilities of humans in industrial and household environments. His research includes topics in
the areas of Robot Learning, Embodied AI, Neuro-symbolic Reasoning, and Machine Learning
theory (e.g., Multimodal Representation Learning, Transfer Learning, and Reinforcement
Learning). Jonathan has published over 50 research articles in Robotics, Machine Learning (ML),
Artificial Intelligence (AI), Sensing, and Automation conference and journal venues, and he
holds over 30 granted and provisional patents in multiple countries. He frequently serves as an
Area Chair / Scientific Advisory Board member / Technical Program Committee member of
various Robotics, Machine Learning, and AI conference and journal publication venues, and he
is a consistent lead organizer of various academic workshops, tutorials, and special meetings. At
Bosch, he maintains several strong collaborations throughout Bosch Global, has extensive
experience in industrial deployments of AI/ML methods to manufacturing plants, and has
established strong connections to Bosch manufacturing plants for co-development and
deployment. He is responsible for a diverse portfolio of BCAI and CMU research projects,
cross-institutional collaborations, student and junior researcher advisees, and publicly-funded
activities. Jonathan received his Ph.D. from the Language Technologies Institute in the School of
Computer Science at CMU and his B.S. and M.S. from the Department of Electrical & Computer
Engineering at CMU.</p>
